This post is a part of the 'how to' series which I will keep updating in course of time.

## 1. How to check if the variable is a string ?

if `typeof input === 'string'` is true. It is a string.

## 2. How to check if the variable is an Object ?

if `typeof yourVariable === 'object' && yourVariable !== null` is true. It is an Object.

> `typeof null` is 'object'
