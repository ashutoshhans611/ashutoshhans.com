Hooks are new addition in React 16.8 which lets us use state and other React features without the need of writing a class.

## What are the current problems ? 
1. Reusing logic, Wrapper hell, Data flow
1. Giant components
1. confusing classes - function to class conversion is a lot of effort, (hard for machines, mehthod unminified), hot reloading difficult
